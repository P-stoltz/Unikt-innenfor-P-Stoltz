        <div class="grid-item item3">
            Malta has a democratic system where the government is led by a prime minister, 
            while a president serves as the head of state with mostly symbolic duties. 
            The Maltese Parliament is made up of one chamber called the House of Representatives, 
            where members are elected every five years. The country’s elections use a system called single transferable voting, 
            which ensures that all votes help to decide who gets seats.

            Currently, Robert Abela from the Labour Party is Malta’s prime minister. 
            The Labour Party has been in power since 2013 and won the last election in 2022, 
            showing that many people still support their leadership.
