            In Malta, school is free for kids from ages 5 to 16. It starts with six years of primary school, then five years of secondary school. 
            After secondary, students can choose to go to Sixth Form for two more years to prepare for A-level exams, which they need for university. 
            Lessons are mostly in English and Maltese, and schools include public, church, and private options, with private schools charging fees.</div>

        I talked to a few local students who said they like that they can choose academic or vocational paths after secondary school. 
        However, some wish there were better facilities and more activities outside of class.
