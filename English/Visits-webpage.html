            First, I took a private boat tour around the Grand Harbour, 
            and it was amazing! Cruising around the harbor, 
            you get these incredible views of the city’s old fortifications and colorful buildings all along the coast. 
            The water was so blue, and the guide shared some fun facts about the history of the place.</div>

            Then, I went to St. John’s Co-Cathedral. The outside looks pretty plain, but as soon as you step in, 
            it’s like, whoa! The whole place is covered in gold details and beautiful artwork, including these huge paintings by Caravaggio. 
            It’s super impressive and has this old, majestic vibe that you can feel as you walk around. </div>
