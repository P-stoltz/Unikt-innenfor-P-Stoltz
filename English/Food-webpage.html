            At  MUŻA Restaurant, I had a modern take on Maltese rabbit stew, right inside the art museum—it was cozy and flavorful. 
            Papannis Restaurant was perfect for fresh seafood linguine in a friendly, Italian-style setting. 
            And Mina’s was laid-back and delicious, where I enjoyed a traditional ftira sandwich and some amazing pastizzi pastries. 
            Each spot gave me a taste of authentic Maltese flavors, and I loved it! </div>
