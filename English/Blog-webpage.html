        <div class="grid-item item1"><h1>The people living there</h1><p>Malta is a pretty small island with about 500,000 people living there. Most of the people are Maltese, but there’s a mix of other ethnic groups too, and it’s getting more diverse as more people move there from different countries. In general, people in Malta are open-minded and welcoming toward others, no matter where they’re from. It’s a tolerant place where people from all kinds of backgrounds are respected and accepted.</p>
